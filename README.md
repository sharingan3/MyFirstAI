INTRO:
This is my first ai. I know it isn't the best, but it's a start!

RULES:
So the rules are simple, the snake keep's moving forwards in his current direction. Example: let's say the current dirrection is down, then the snake will move down one square 
every second untill his current direction changes. Everytime the snake eats an apple, his body get's longer. The snake dies if it's head hit's the wall or his body. The goal of 
the snake is too get as long as possible.

HOW MY AI THINKS:
My AI simply finds the y and x distance between his head and the apple. Then he moves accordingly. It doesn't avoid obstacles, yet(I'm making him doing that right now).
